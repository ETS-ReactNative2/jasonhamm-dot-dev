Leveraging the fast loading speed and great SEO ranking of static HTML (compared to
your traditional React app), I created my personal React website using GatsbyJS. Further, I deployed my website with Netlify's CMS for easy on-the-fly updating, editing, and continuous deployment.

To handle email functionality with my staticly rendered webpage, I utilized Netlify's Lambda Functions and Sendgrid.
