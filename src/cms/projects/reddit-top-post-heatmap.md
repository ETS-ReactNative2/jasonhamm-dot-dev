Quickly find out the best time to generate the most impact on your favorite
subreddit.

Utilizing Reddit's API, the user can search a subreddit and then visualize the
top 100 posts made within the last year in a heatmap. Then, to further inspect
the data, the user can select on an occupied heatmap cell to view the respective
posts.

For later viewing, the user can: create an account, save their heatmap, and then
view their snapshot at any time.
