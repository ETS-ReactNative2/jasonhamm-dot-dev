Following a freely available Figma design file, I implemented 20 unique
modern UI components, such as checkboxes, toggles, and dropdown menus, with
Storybook and CSS.

Each component is fit with dynamic and responsive states, and many have access
to different colored themes and simulate data handling via Storybook's actions
addon.
